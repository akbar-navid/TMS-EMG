# TMS-EMG Forward and Inverse Regression Modeling

## Project Summary
Please take a look at our papers below, for the corresponding coding folders:
1. ```inv_TNSRE``` [Inverse (EMG->TMS: 2022)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.22.501062v2.abstract)
2. ```fwd_PETRA``` [Forward (TMS->EMG: 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3389189.3389203)
3. ```fwd_NER``` [Forward (TMS->EMG, Preliminary: 2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8717159)

<!-- ## Prerequisites
Please install all necessary library versions by typing in terminal:

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` -->

## File Structure
```
|--<data>
|--coding file (e.g. inv_TNSRE\inverse.ipynb)
```

<!-- ## Usage
Clone this repo, and copy the _\_data_ folder from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/icfard16qqjpqrm/AAA3oMcZpGe1C0HZfqpflVIOa?dl=0) to the root directory [as shown in the file tree above], for all codes to work.

The code runs from terminal using ```main.py```, with supporting functions automatically parsed from ```models.py```, ```helper.py```, and open-sourced functions from the folder ```extra```.

Plots for results can be generated using ```plot_csv.py```

Some residual code snippets and inline results+visualization can be found in ```multimodal_RA.ipynb```

The raw source files can be found in _/SDrive/CSL/\_Archive/2019/DT\_LONI\_Epileptogenesis\_2019_ -->
